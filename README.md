# FritzCallIndicator
FritzCallIndicator displays a notification pop-up in the taskbar for incoming calls from the Fritz!Box.

This utility is heavily inspired by [FritzBoxCallMonitor](https://github.com/petermost/FritzBoxCallMonitor) and using its main logic for connecting to the Fritz!Box for receiving calls.
In addition, FritzCallIndicator can also use Thunderbird address books and online telecommunications directories to reverse lookup the number of the incoming caller. If the number cannot be resolved, the tool will show the country or city of origin of the call (currently only Germany cities supported).
